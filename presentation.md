# I'm a designer & programmer
## I work in software development and integration

# I do these things ...
## I design
I currently work on human resources management softwares at the french Ministry of Education.
Actually I design software for data analysis of the individual retirement pension accounts.
## I code
I write code most of which is in java, angular or swift language.
Quality is a primary goal. I encourage continuous delivery because it helps nailing user expectations.
## I teach
I teach how to use the software to pension administrators.
I write papers, organize events, and speak.

# Things I like
## Explore
I'm curious about people, ideas and things. I imagine how we can do better.
My activity often goes from proofs of concepts to frameworks.
A few years ago I had the opportunity to setup a completely new software environment at http://www.xloan.fr.
Currently I experiment, here http://www.arfntz.fr and there https://github.com/arfntz, with mobile devices and distributed architectures.
## Design
Giving shapes to ideas.
I began with software technical design, then I went through information system architectures, and then worked as CTO for the company Mco-Finance.
I'm focused on User Experience. My design activities have the organization's objectives and culture in mind.
Agility methods (Scrum, SAFe) have changed organizations. I passed the 'Leading SAFe' (https://www.scaledagile.com/) certification in 2019.
## Teach
I find teaching and training others very rewarding; an opportunity for both teacher and learner to grow their expertise. I experienced teaching to kids and adults, first as animator in summer camps, then as a professional software engineer. In 2018 I went back to primary school within a volunteer association, to help children doing their homework.
## Play
Sometimes I stand at a piano or a drumset and play music in a band, for an audience, in venues.
Personally it's a game towards expression and freedom, being given some finite conditions of a musical instrument.
Collectively, with bandmates I learn about contribution and communication, and experience what a team can do.
We always learn from feedback.
Sometimes I also publish a music on https://soundcloud.com/arfntz.

## Intro
Hi, my name is F E. I'm a software designer.
I got a bunch of Slackware floppy disks on a birthday way back.
Since then I've been writing code as a hobbyist, full-time employee in private and public organisations, or just to give something back to the open-source community.
My particular interests are learning methods and software design, which I'm currently practicing full-time at the french Ministry of Education, as I work on pension management information systems.

## Timeline
1996 Education
I studied Computer Science at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, UK. I hold a BSc. in Computer Science with first-class honours (graduated 1998).

1998 Into industry
I started working at a web development agency, where I had the opportunity to more fully develop my skills with LAMP. I also wrote a search engine in perl language.

2000 Framework design and software integration
I joined a team working on a new banking system and gained experience with J2E, designing frameworks, and software integration.

2001 Technical design and guidance
A software company, MCO Finance, hired me as technical guide in rewriting their ERP solution, Xloan. This rewrite involved software design from the ground, as well as teaching new methods to co-workers.

2009 Cloud design and information system management
As CTO I managed a team of developers and lead the cloud transformation for Xloan. This was a 9 years cross-disciplinary experience.

2018 Experiential learning
For the purpose of furthering my interests in teaching and learning methods, I decided to work towards a Master in Computer Science and Enterprise Management (graduated 2019), while working as a software engineer at the french Ministry of Education, my actual position.

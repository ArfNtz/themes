# I'm a designer & programmer
## I work in software development and integration

# I do these things ...
## I design
I currently work on human resources management softwares at the french Ministry of Education.
Undergoing changes on the information system are consequences of the government's decisions.
In particular I provide software for data analysis of the individual retirement pension accounts.
## I code
I write code most of which is in java, angular or swift language.
Quality is a primary goal, and the continuous delivery process helps to nail user expectations.
## I teach
I teach how to use the software to pension administrators.
I write papers, organize events, and speak.

# Things I like
## Explore
I'm curious about others, then I imagine how we can do better.
My activity often goes from proofs of concepts to frameworks.
A few years ago I had the opportunity to setup a completely new software environment at http://www.xloan.fr.
On my spare time I experiment, here http://www.arfntz.fr and there https://github.com/arfntz, with mobile devices and distributed architectures.
## Design
Giving shapes to ideas.
I started design on the technical software side, and went through information system architectures when I worked as CTO for the company Mco-Finance.
I'm focused on User Experience. My design activities have the organization's goal and culture in mind.
Agility methods (Scrum, SAFe) have changed organizations. I passed the 'Leading SAFe' (https://www.scaledagile.com/) certification in 2019.
## Teach
I find teaching and training others very rewarding; an opportunity for both teacher and learner to grow their expertise. I experienced teaching to kids and adults, first as animator in summer camps, then as a professional software engineer. In 2018 I went back to primary school within a volunteer association, to help children doing their homework.
## Play
I stand at a piano or a drumset and play music in a band, in front of an audience.
It's a game toward expression and freedom, being given some finite conditions, called 'musical instrument'.
With bandmates I learn about contribution and communication and experience what a team can do.
Sometimes I also publish a music here https://soundcloud.com/arfntz. We always learn from feedbacks.

## Intro

I got a bunch of Slackware floppy disks on a birthday way back.
Since then I've been writing code as a hobbyist, full-time employee in private and public organisations, or just to give something back to the open-source community.

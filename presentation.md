# I'm a designer & programmer
## I work in software development and integration

# I do these things ...
## I design
I currently work on human resources management software at the french Ministry of Education.
Undergoing changes on the information system are consequences of the government's decisions.
In particular I provide software for data analysis of the individual pension accounts.
## I code
I write code most of which is in java, angular or swift language.
Quality and continuous delivery makes coding interesting to me, as we nail user expectations.
## I teach
I teach pension administrators how to use the software.
I write papers, organize events, and speak.

# Things I like
## Explore
I'm curious about others. I try to imagine how we could do things in better ways.
My activity often goes from proofs of concepts to frameworks.
This lead me, a few years ago, to set up a complete framwork and software environement for http://www.Xloan.fr
On my spare time I experiment, here http://www.arfntz.fr and there https://github.com/arfntz, with mobile devices and distributed architectures.
## Design
Giving shapes to ideas.
I started on the sofware side of design, and went through information system architectures when I worked as CTO for the company Mco-Finance, for 18 years.
Nowadays I'm focused on User Experience. My design activities have the organization's goal and culture in mind.
Agility methods (Scrum, SAFe) have changed organizations. I passed the 'Leading SAFe' (https://www.scaledagile.com/) certification in 2019.
## Play
I sit at a piano or a drumset and play music in a band.
Personnaly it's a game toward expression and freedom given finite conditions of an instrument.
With bandmates I learn about communication and participate to what a team can do.
Sometimes I publish a music here https://soundcloud.com/arfntz, learning from feedbacks.
## Teach
I find teaching and training others very rewarding; an opportunity for both teacher and learner to grow their expertise.

## Intro
Hi, my name is F E. I'm a software designer.
I got a bunch of Slackware floppy disks for a birthday way back.
Since then I've been writing code as a hobbyist, full-time employee in private and public organisations, or just to give something back to the open-source community.
My particular interests are in sofware and design, which I'm currently practicing full-time at the french Ministry of Education, as I work on pension management software.

## Skills
swift (for Apple and Linux platforms)
java (spring)
node.js (angular)
php (symfony)

## Timeline
1996 Education
I began working toward my BSc. in Computer Science with first class honours, at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, UK.

1998 Into industry
I started working at a web development agency, where I had the opportunity to more fully develop my skills with LAMP. I also developped a search engine in perl.

2000 Framework design and software delivery
I joined a team working on a new banking system and gained experience with J2E, designing frameworks, and software integration.

2001 Technical design and guidance
A software company, MCO Finance, hired me to give technical guidance in rewriting their ERP, Xloan. The rewrite involved software design from the ground, as well as teaching new methods to co-workers.

2009 Cloud design and information system management
As CTO I managed a team of developers and leaded the cloud transformation for Xloan. This was a 9 years cross-disciplinary experience.

2018 Graduation
Going back to my interests for teching and learning methods, I decided to take my education further and started working toward a Master diploma. I graduated in november 2019, while working as a software engineer at the french Ministry of Education, my actual position.

# I'm a software designer & coder

# I do these things ...
## I design
I currently work on retirement pensions at the french Ministry of Education.
The government defines the way pensions are managed.
This implies undergoing changes to the information system.
I provide software for data analysis of the individual retirement accounts.
The database holds 1.400.000 accounts.
## I code
I write code most of which is in java, angular or swift language.
## I teach
I teach to pensions administrators how to use new softwares.
I write papers, organize events, and speak.

# Things I love
## Explore
I'm curious about others. I try to imagine how we could better.
My activity often goes from proofs of concepts to frameworks.
This lead me, a few years ago, to set up a complete framwork and software environement for http://www.Xloan.fr
On my spare time I experiment, here http://www.arfntz.fr and there https://github.com/arfntz, with mobile devices and distributed architectures.
## Design
Giving shapes to ideas.
I started on the sofware side of design, and went through information system architectures when I worked as CTO for the company Mco-Finance, for 18 years.
Nowadays I'm focused on User Experience. My design activities have the organization's goal and culture in mind.
Agility methods (Scrum, SAFe) have changed organizations. I passed the 'Leading SAFe' (https://www.scaledagile.com/) certification in 2019.
## Play
I sit at a piano or a drumset and play music in a band.
Personnaly it's a game toward expression and freedom given finite conditions of an instrument.
With bandmates I learn about communication and participate to what a team can do.
Sometimes I publish a music here https://soundcloud.com/arfntz, learning from feedbacks.
## Teach
I find teaching and training others very rewarding; an opportunity for both teacher and learner to grow their expertise.

## Intro
Hi, my name is F E. I'm a software designer.
I found a bunch of Slackware floppy disks on a birthday way back.
Since then I've been writing code as a hobbyist, full-time employee in private and public organisations, or just to give something back to the open-source community.
My particular interests lie in sofware and design, which I'm currently practicing full-time at the french Ministry of Education, as I work on pension management software.

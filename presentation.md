# I'm a designer & programmer
## I work in software development and integration

# I do these things ...
## I design
I currently work on human resources management softwares at the french Ministry of Education.
In particular I provide software for data analysis of the individual retirement pension accounts.
## I code
I write code most of which is in java, angular or swift language.
Quality is a primary goal, and the continuous delivery process helps to nail user expectations.
## I teach
I teach how to use the software to pension administrators.
I write papers, organize events, and speak.

# Things I like
## Explore
I'm curious. I imagine how we can do better.
My activity often goes from proofs of concepts to frameworks.
A few years ago I had the opportunity to setup a completely new software environment at http://www.xloan.fr.
Currently I experiment, here http://www.arfntz.fr and there https://github.com/arfntz, with mobile devices and distributed architectures.
## Design
Giving shapes to ideas.
First I did software technical design, then I went through information system architectures, and then worked as CTO for the company Mco-Finance.
I'm focused on User Experience. My design activities have the organization's goal and culture in mind.
Agility methods (Scrum, SAFe) have changed organizations. I passed the 'Leading SAFe' (https://www.scaledagile.com/) certification in 2019.
## Teach
I find teaching and training others very rewarding; an opportunity for both teacher and learner to grow their expertise. I experienced teaching to kids and adults, first as animator in summer camps, then as a professional software engineer. In 2018 I went back to primary school within a volunteer association, to help children doing their homework.
## Play
Sometimes I stand at a piano or a drumset and play music in a band, for an audience, in venues.
First it's a game toward expression and freedom, being given some finite conditions, called 'musical instrument' ;)
Then with bandmates I learn about contribution and communication, and experience what a team can do.
Sometimes I also publish a music here https://soundcloud.com/arfntz. We always learn from feedbacks.

## Intro
Hi, my name is F E. I'm a software designer.
I got a bunch of Slackware floppy disks on a birthday way back.
Since then I've been writing code as a hobbyist, full-time employee in private and public organisations, or just to give something back to the open-source community.
My particular interests are learning methods and software design, which I'm currently practicing full-time at the french Ministry of Education, as I work on pension management information systems.

## Timeline
1996 Education
I studied Computer Science at Teesside University in Middlesbrough, UK. I hold a BSc. in Computer Science with first-class honours (graduated 1998).

1998 Into industry
I started working at a web development agency, where I had the opportunity to more fully develop my skills with LAMP. I also wrote a search engine in perl language.

2000 Framework design and software integration
I joined a team working on a new banking system and gained experience with J2E, designing frameworks, and software integration.

2001 Technical design and guidance
A software company, MCO Finance, hired as technical guide in rewriting their ERP, Xloan. This rewrite involved software design from the ground, as well as teaching new methods to co-workers.

2009 Cloud design and information system management
As CTO I managed a team of developers and lead the cloud transformation for Xloan. This was a 9 years cross-disciplinary experience.

2018 Experiential learning
For the purpose of furthering my interests in teaching and learning methods, I decided to work towards a Master in Computer Science and Enterprise Management (graduated 2019), while working as a software engineer at the french Ministry of Education, my actual position.
